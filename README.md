# Thesis_wouter_oerlemans
This is the code used for my thesis
all codes from step 1 till step 4 are used to transform the dataset to be compatible with the packages used to execute the attribution models.
all code in the map analysis code is the code used for the data analysis. the t-test-data-sets.r is used for computing the difference in means between the two datasets (unlimited touchpoints - max 60 days between touches)
attribution_ticketsale_level.r is used for calculating the attribution results for the the different datasets and to plot the results. this is on conversion level.
logistic_regression_attribution.r is used to calculale the ROC of the different attribution models used in the analysis
proportion_of_conversion.r is used to calculate the proportions of conversion devided over the amount of touchpoints.
